**Project Features:**

*   **Microservice Architecture:** The application is designed as a standalone microservice, providing a specific functionality within a larger system.
*   **React Framework:** Built using the React JavaScript library for a dynamic and interactive user interface.
*   **Dockerized:** Containerized using a Dockerfile, ensuring consistent and reproducible builds and deployments.
*   **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):** Automated deployment pipeline using Azure DevOps to build, test, and deploy the application to Kubernetes.
*   **Kubernetes Deployment:** Deployed as a Kubernetes Deployment, enabling features like scaling, rolling updates, and self-healing.

**Getting Started:**

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
Build and Push Image (using Azure DevOps):

Trigger the Azure DevOps pipeline.
The pipeline will:
Build the Docker image using the provided Dockerfile.
Push the image to Docker Hub.
Deploy to Kubernetes:

The pipeline will then deploy the image to Kubernetes using the deployment.yaml manifest.
Development:

Develop and test the React application within the src directory.
Update the Dockerfile as needed to include any new dependencies or configurations.
Modify the deployment.yaml to adjust deployment settings (e.g., replicas, resource limits).
